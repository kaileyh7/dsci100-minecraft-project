    "\n",
    "### `players.csv`\n",
    "**Dataset Overview**\n",
    "- The `players.csv` dataset contains 196 observations and 7 variables, each representing unique player characteristics such as age, country, playtime, and newsletter subscription status.\n",
    "- The mean value of `played_hours` is 5.85 hours, and the mean value of `Age` is 21.14 years in the `players.csv` dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**\n",
    "- The player’s self-reported experience level: `experience`\n",
    "- Whether the player subscribed to the game-related newsletter: `subscribe`\n",
    "- Unique, anonymized player identifier: `hashedEmail`\n",
    "- Total number of hours the player has spent in the game: `played_hours`\n",
    "- Player’s chosen display name: `name`\n",
    "- Gender of the player (if provided): `gender`\n",
    "- Age of the player in years: `Age`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `sessions.csv`\n",
    "**Dataset Overview**\n",
    "- The `sessions.csv` dataset includes 1535 observations and 5 variables, each representing an individual game session, including duration, start time, and in-game actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**\n",
    "- Unique, anonymized player identifier: `hashedEmail`\n",
    "- Timestamp when the recorded session began: `start_time`\n",
    "- Timestamp when the session ended: `end_time`\n",
    "- The original session start time: `original_start_time`\n",
    "- The original session end time: `original_end_time`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality Issues\n",
    "- Some players appear with very short or zero `played_hours`.\n",
    "- The `name` variable may include duplicates usernames or inconsistent capitalization.\n",
    "- There are some missing values for `Age`.\n",
    "- Potential duplicates in `hashedEmail`.\n",
    "- `start_time` and `end_time` might include time zone inconsistencies or overlapping sessions for the same user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection Method\n",
    "The data was collected from a research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood. As players engaged with the Minecraft server they set up, the server continuously logged their actions, session times, and account information (such as playtime, experience level, and subscription status)."
